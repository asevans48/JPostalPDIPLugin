# JPostalPDI Plugin

A working plugin for Spoon 8.2 and Pentaho/Vantara Data Integration
that splits addresses into their respective parts through JPostal.

Requires libpostal to be installed and on your path and a jar for JPostal
to be on the path to pdi libraries as specified in your Pentaho install.

WARNING: I used a template to generate the code so there is an issue with
margins.
